    <p>I'm an Applied Mathematics and Computer Science student who is driven by a desire to help make technology that improves our quality of life. My areas of interest are in the fields
      of cryptography, machine learning, low-level programming, and operating systems. When I'm not studying or coding, you can find me experimenting with coffee,
      playing my guitar, writing poetry, or exploring the great outdoors.</p>

          title = "Playcaller"
          description="Done as part of a research project on the concept of Disposable Development Environments, Playcaller takes the ideas behind an autoconfiguration 
          script and pushes it to the max. This utility uses Ansible as a backend for creating automation scripts for the configuration and set up of any
          computer running a UNIX-based operating system."

          title = "qSypher"
          description="qSypher (Quantum Sypher) is an undergraduate research project I'm doing with Martin Burns and Ryad Ouhhabi where we are developing a hashing
          algorithm and cipher for encryption on quantum computer systems. As part of this research project I am writing a memory-safe cryptographic tool for quantum
          encrpytion/decryption."

        <Project
          title="sypherOS"
          description="I was inspired by DHH and his Omarchy project to make my own interpretation of a developer friendly, preconfigured Arch Linux spin but instead
          of using a conventional tiling window manager such as Hyprland, it uses the Niri scrolling window manager. I also wanted to provide a much less opinionated
          version of Arch for developers with minimum setup."
