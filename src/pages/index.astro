      <p>I'm a third-year Applied Mathematics and Computer Science student interested in the areas of cryptography, machine learning, and operating systems. 
        I'm also a big proponent of Free (as in Freedom) software and love supporting and working on open-source projects. When I'm not studying or coding, 
        you can find me experimenting with coffee, playing my guitar, writing poetry, or exploring the great outdoors.</p>

        <Project
          title = "Playcaller"
          description="Done as part of a research project on the concept of Disposable Development Environments, Playcaller takes the ideas behind an autoconfiguration 
          script and pushes it to the max. This utility uses Ansible as a backend for creating automation scripts for the configuration and set up of any
          computer running a UNIX-based operating system."

        <Project
          title = "qSypher"
          description="qSypher (Quantum Sypher) is an undergraduate research project I'm doing with Martin Burns and Ryad Ouhhabi where we are developing a hashing
          algorithm and cipher for encryption on quantum computer systems. As part of this research project I am writing a memory-safe cryptographic tool for quantum
          encrpytion/decryption."

        <Project
          title="sypherOS"
          description="A project heavily inspired by the Omarchy project, SypherOS is a Fedora-based distribution which aims to provide a developer friendly, 
          preconfigured desktop which uses the Niri scrolling window manager. The goal of this project is to allow people to get 90% of the benefits of 
          tiling desktops, but not nearly as opinionated as Omarchy."
          tags={["Linux"]}
        />

        <Project
          title="Billboard Top-40 Tracker"
          description="This was a weekend project to help me with DJ-ing at my college radio station. The station has a strict policy against playing music
          from the Billboard Top 40, but you would have to manually look up artists to see if they charted. I wrote a program which searches through 
          a database updated weekly to determine how many songs have charted from an artist."
