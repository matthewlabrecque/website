      <p>I'm a third-year Applied Mathematics and Computer Science student interested in the areas of cryptography, machine learning, and operating systems. 
        I'm also a big proponent of Free (as in Freedom) software and love supporting and working on open-source projects. When I'm not studying or coding, 
        you can find me experimenting with coffee, playing my guitar, writing poetry, or exploring the great outdoors.</p>

        <Project
          title="Billboard Top-40 Tracker"
        description="A Python-based utility designed to automate the retrieval the performance data of music which appeared on the Billboard Top 100. The tool 
        allows users to query current and past Top 100 rankings, and returns the number of songs a given artist has in the Top 100, as well as the name of any
        song which placed in the Top 40. The reason I created this utility was to assist myself and other DJ’s at WUNH, the college radio station at UNH, which
        has a strict “no Top 40” policy for playing music. This project focuses on clean data extraction, error handling, and modular script design, providing a
        lightweight yet robust way to monitor trends in the music industry. "

        <Project
          title="Fedora Giulia Spin"
          description="A specialized Linux workstation for developers built on the Fedora “leading-edge” philosophy with the goal of offering a high-performance, 
          out-of-the-box experience for developers who want 90% of the efficiency of a custom TWM without the configuration overhead. It features a preconfigured workflow 
          centered around the Niri scrolling window manager. Giulia is designed as a general-purpose developer suite, providing batteries-included support
          for Rust, Go, Python, Java, and C/C++, alongside a container-ready Podman environment and a LazyVim-powered Neovim setup. This project was my first foray
          into developing a truly open-source project for the general public."

        <Project
          title = "Playcaller"
          description="Done as part of a research project on the concept of Disposable Development Environments, Playcaller takes the ideas behind an autoconfiguration 
          script and pushes it to the max. This utility uses Ansible as a backend for creating automation scripts for the configuration and set up of any
          computer running a UNIX-based operating system."

        <!--<Project
          title = "qSypher"
        description="qSypher (Quantum Sypher) is an undergraduate research initiative conducted in collaboration with Martin Burns and Ryad Ouhhabi, focused on 
        the development of hashing algorithms and ciphers designed for the quantum computing era. The project addresses the vulnerabilities of classical 
        encryption by engineering quantum-resistant primitives. My primary contribution to this initiative is the architecture and development of a memory-safe
        cryptographic toolset for encryption and decryption. By prioritizing memory safety, the tool aims to eliminate common implementation vulnerabilities."
